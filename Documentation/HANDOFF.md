# Little Herd — handoff

**State:** `main` @ `d995182`, clean, pushed. Latest release `v0.1.21`;
the cancellation fix since then is unreleased. 264 tests.
Installed and running: 0.1.21. Nothing unreleased.

**The Synology is fixed.** Drive 2 was replaced on 17 August 2026 — a WD40EFZZ
(4 TB, CMR) for the WD30EFRX that had shed 231 uncorrectable sectors. Pool
`reuse_1` rebuilt overnight and now reports `normal`, raid status 1, 4/4
devices, every drive at `unc=0`. Time Machine on the mini was paused for the
rebuild and is back on — verified: `AutoBackup = 1`, last backup
2026-08-17 21:54, one running since. The extra 1 TB stays stranded until a second 3 TB drive is
replaced; SHR needs two disks larger than the rest before it can use the space.
All three survivors are the same age and batch as the one that failed.

## What the 0.1.15 → 0.1.21 run did

Started from "write view tests" and became eleven releases. The view work
extracted display decisions out of SwiftUI bodies into `MachinePresentation.swift`,
which immediately exposed two live bugs — the same machine reporting two
different statuses, and a fix that had landed in one surface but not its twin.
Then the audit leftovers, drag affordances, sustained-load alerts, a
sign-in-lost alert, remote CPU measurement, and a Finder-style folder browser
with a Full Disk Access flow.

## Hard-won facts

**Read every field before trusting one.** This bit twice in a day.
`raidType: single` does not mean "no redundancy" — it means one RAID group;
`hasParity: true` and 8.99 TB from 4×3 TB were the tells, and the previous
handoff had it wrong. `up_time: 2043` is hours, not days. Both were arithmetic
mistakes dressed as facts, and both changed the advice completely.

**macOS has no shell-readable CPU counter.** `kern.cp_time` is FreeBSD;
`top -l 1` and `iostat -c 1` report since-boot averages far too coarse to
difference. A remote Mac's CPU therefore comes from `iostat` watching for the
whole sampling interval, which paces the loop — verified live at 1.09 s and
10.08 s.

**`AsyncStream.onTermination` fires on task cancellation, not on `break`.** An
earlier version hung process termination on it and assumed a consumer leaving a
`for await` was enough. It is not, so nothing was terminated and a `du` walked
/System after the app quit. Cancellation now comes from
`withTaskCancellationHandler` as well.

**`du` full-buffers its output to a pipe.** Measured: `du -sk /bin /sbin /usr`
delivered all three lines in the same millisecond; separate invocations
delivered `/usr` 160 ms later. Streaming the reader cannot help if the writer
never writes, so each path gets its own `du` inside one shell command.

**`used = total − available` is right, and the obvious correction is wrong.**
A Mac's startup row is one volume of a container whose siblings are not listed,
so what it reports using is the sealed system alone — 17 GB where the container
holds 945 GB. Believing it reads a nearly full disk as a quarter full.

**`SYNO.FileStation.DirSize` is unusable on this DSM.** It starts a task,
returns an id, then answers 599 — "no such task" — to every status call, on
both API versions, for two shares. Measured against the live NAS.

**TCC attributes a spawned command to the app that spawned it.** A disk scanner
therefore trips a permission dialog per protected folder. Remote machines are
unaffected because their commands run under `sshd`, which already has Full Disk
Access — which is also why tunnelling to localhost is not the answer: it obtains
the same access through a wider door and leaves the door open.

## Method notes

**Look at it.** Four times in one session something obviously correct on paper
was wrong when run — and every UI defect (a folder named `Library` rendered as
`L`, no disclosure triangle, a spinner that never moved) was invisible to 263
passing tests.

**Break the test to prove it works.** Every substantive rule was verified by
reintroducing the bug and watching the suite fail. Two tests that passed without
proving anything were caught this way: one watched a side effect a killed shell
would not perform, another counted processes with a command containing the
pattern it grepped for.

**Commit early.** A worktree was deleted mid-session with uncommitted work in
it; the files survived only because the directory had not been reaped yet.

## Next

1. **P-core/E-core awareness is blocked, not pending.** Per-core utilisation
   needs root on a remote Mac — `powermetrics` refuses without it, and neither
   `top` nor `iostat` exposes per-core lines. It would work on this Mac and no
   other, which in an app about a herd is an inconsistency rather than a
   feature. Reopen only if a way to get it without root appears.
2. **This Mac reports only its startup volume** while remote Macs enumerate
   everything under `/Volumes`. `MetricsSampler.storageVolumes()` returns one
   entry; the remote script lists all of them and filters read-only and
   image-backed mounts. Worth making consistent, in the direction of the remote
   behaviour.

## Keeping this file honest

It is the roadmap; there is no other tracker. Update it at the end of a session
rather than writing a fresh one by hand, and delete items that are done — a
handoff nobody trusts is worse than none.
