# Little Herd — handoff

**State:** `main` is clean and pushed, and carries the `v0.1.22` release plus
edits to this file — no unreleased code, so the last code commit is the tag.
264 tests, all passing. The feed is live and was checked rather than assumed:
the appcast at the `releases/latest` URL names `LittleHerd-0.1.22.zip`, carries
a signature, and the asset returns 200. Installed and running here is 0.1.22,
taken there through Sparkle from 0.1.21 and verified — see below.

Deliberately no commit hash in this paragraph. The previous two sessions each
left one that was stale within the hour, including the one written to correct
its predecessor: a line naming a commit is out of date the moment anything is
committed, this file included. `git log` answers that question and cannot be
wrong; what belongs here is what `git log` will not tell you.

**The Synology is fixed.** Drive 2 was replaced on 17 August 2026 — a WD40EFZZ
(4 TB, CMR) for the WD30EFRX that had shed 231 uncorrectable sectors. Pool
`reuse_1` rebuilt overnight and now reports `normal`, raid status 1, 4/4
devices, every drive at `unc=0`. Time Machine on the mini was paused for the
rebuild and is back on — verified: `AutoBackup = 1`, last backup
2026-08-17 21:54, one running since. The extra 1 TB stays stranded until a second 3 TB drive is
replaced; SHR needs two disks larger than the rest before it can use the space.
All three survivors are the same age and batch as the one that failed.

## What the 0.1.15 → 0.1.21 run did

Started from "write view tests" and became eleven releases. The view work
extracted display decisions out of SwiftUI bodies into `MachinePresentation.swift`,
which immediately exposed two live bugs — the same machine reporting two
different statuses, and a fix that had landed in one surface but not its twin.
Then the audit leftovers, drag affordances, sustained-load alerts, a
sign-in-lost alert, remote CPU measurement, and a Finder-style folder browser
with a Full Disk Access flow.

## Hard-won facts

**Read every field before trusting one.** This bit twice in a day.
`raidType: single` does not mean "no redundancy" — it means one RAID group;
`hasParity: true` and 8.99 TB from 4×3 TB were the tells, and the previous
handoff had it wrong. `up_time: 2043` is hours, not days. Both were arithmetic
mistakes dressed as facts, and both changed the advice completely.

**macOS has no shell-readable CPU counter.** `kern.cp_time` is FreeBSD;
`top -l 1` and `iostat -c 1` report since-boot averages far too coarse to
difference. A remote Mac's CPU therefore comes from `iostat` watching for the
whole sampling interval, which paces the loop — verified live at 1.09 s and
10.08 s.

**`AsyncStream.onTermination` fires on task cancellation, not on `break`.** An
earlier version hung process termination on it and assumed a consumer leaving a
`for await` was enough. It is not, so nothing was terminated and a `du` walked
/System after the app quit. Cancellation now comes from
`withTaskCancellationHandler` as well.

**`du` full-buffers its output to a pipe.** Measured: `du -sk /bin /sbin /usr`
delivered all three lines in the same millisecond; separate invocations
delivered `/usr` 160 ms later. Streaming the reader cannot help if the writer
never writes, so each path gets its own `du` inside one shell command.

**`used = total − available` is right, and the obvious correction is wrong.**
A Mac's startup row is one volume of a container whose siblings are not listed,
so what it reports using is the sealed system alone — 17 GB where the container
holds 945 GB. Believing it reads a nearly full disk as a quarter full.

**`SYNO.FileStation.DirSize` is unusable on this DSM.** It starts a task,
returns an id, then answers 599 — "no such task" — to every status call, on
both API versions, for two shares. Measured against the live NAS.

**This Mac reporting only its startup volume is deliberate, not drift.** It was
listed as an inconsistency to fix and should not have been: enumerating mounted
volumes can raise macOS's network-volume privacy prompt even when network
entries are filtered afterwards, which is why routine sampling stays scoped to
`/` and broader discovery sits behind `NetworkVolumeOnboardingView`. The reason
is in a comment above `MetricsSampler.storageVolumes()`. A remote Mac's `df`
runs under sshd, which already holds those permissions; this Mac's does not.
Practically nothing is hidden — this Mac has one volume plus Recovery, which
both paths exclude.

**TCC attributes a spawned command to the app that spawned it.** A disk scanner
therefore trips a permission dialog per protected folder. Remote machines are
unaffected because their commands run under `sshd`, which already has Full Disk
Access — which is also why tunnelling to localhost is not the answer: it obtains
the same access through a wider door and leaves the door open.

**Sparkle's last mile works, and it has now been watched rather than assumed.**
The installed 0.1.21 was taken to 0.1.22 through **Check for Updates…** on
18 August 2026: the alert rendered its release notes correctly, the download
ran, `Autoupdate` replaced the bundle, and the app relaunched. Verified after
the fact rather than on the strength of the dialog closing — version and build
`0.1.22`/`23`, a *new inode* for the bundle (55445740 → 55613997, so it was
replaced and not patched), the running process started from `/Applications`
seconds later, `codesign --verify --deep --strict` clean, `spctl` reporting
`Notarized Developer ID`, and a stapled ticket that validates.

**`log stream` is how you find out what the app really did.** The update was
driven by clicking the menu item through the accessibility API, because a
menu-bar app's menu is not visible to a filtered screenshot. The click tool then
reported that the click had been *blocked* — and the app updated anyway. AppKit's
own log settled it: `trackMouse send action on mouseUp` at 06:24:13.903, the
download 65 ms later, `Autoupdate` at 06:24:14.8. The click had landed and the
tool misreported it, most likely re-checking the frontmost app after the dialog
closed and the app began relaunching. Do not trust that error against an app
that is quitting; read the log.

**A warning for "Tailscale is not running" would be worse than nothing.** Linux
showed a dash and "3 of 4 live" for about five minutes on 18 August. The box was
fine — the mini pinged it 2/2 at 9.6 ms and the watchdog held `linux.fails: 0` —
while this Mac could not resolve `*.ts.net` at all (`scutil --dns` carried no
resolver for it). Throughout, the Tailscale `IPNExtension` process *was running*,
so a process-presence check would have reported everything healthy during the one
event it exists to catch. What ssh already prints is the honest signal, and
`RemoteUnavailability.nameNotFound` already turns it into "Check whether Tailscale
is connected." It resolved itself with no intervention.

## Method notes

**Look at it.** Four times in one session something obviously correct on paper
was wrong when run — and every UI defect (a folder named `Library` rendered as
`L`, no disclosure triangle, a spinner that never moved) was invisible to 263
passing tests.

**Break the test to prove it works.** Every substantive rule was verified by
reintroducing the bug and watching the suite fail. Two tests that passed without
proving anything were caught this way: one watched a side effect a killed shell
would not perform, another counted processes with a command containing the
pattern it grepped for.

**Commit early.** A worktree was deleted mid-session with uncommitted work in
it; the files survived only because the directory had not been reaped yet.

## Next

1. **P-core/E-core awareness is blocked, not pending.** Per-core utilisation
   needs root on a remote Mac — `powermetrics` refuses without it, and neither
   `top` nor `iostat` exposes per-core lines. It would work on this Mac and no
   other, which in an app about a herd is an inconsistency rather than a
   feature. Reopen only if a way to get it without root appears.
2. **Nothing else.** The list is short on purpose; see below.

## Keeping this file honest

It is the roadmap; there is no other tracker. Update it at the end of a session
rather than writing a fresh one by hand, and delete items that are done — a
handoff nobody trusts is worse than none.
